Avsar App is a corporate mobile application that enables internal users to securely access department-specific files and provides administrators with user management and communication capabilities.

Through the app, users can browse and open files, while administrators can manage user accounts, assign roles, and maintain full control over the system.

Automated Notification System:
The app detects changes made to shared folders in real time and sends instant notifications to administrators.
This allows admins to quickly recognize when a file has been modified. By tapping on the notification, they are directed to the related file and can immediately review the changes made.

Send Notifications to Users:
Administrators can also send custom messages and subject-based notifications to specific users.
Users receive these messages within the app through the “My Notifications” screen, and can easily view the details or respond if needed.

Avsar streamlines document management, internal communication, and secure access—bringing them all together in one platform to make in-house digital workflows faster, more transparent, and more effective.
