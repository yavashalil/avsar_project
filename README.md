Avsar App is a corporate mobile application designed to enable employees to securely, quickly, and efficiently access department-specific files, while providing managers with powerful tools for user management, internal communication, and file change tracking.

Department-Based File Access:
Users can only view and open folders assigned to their own department.
Files can be opened directly within the app for quick review without unnecessary downloads.

Real-Time Automatic Notification System:
Any addition, deletion, or modification to shared folders is detected instantly.
Managers receive real-time notifications when a change occurs.
Tapping a notification takes the user directly to the file, allowing immediate review of the changes.

Direct Messaging & Targeted Notifications:
Managers can send topic-based or user-specific messages and notifications.
Employees can view these in the "My Notifications" screen, check details, and reply if necessary.

User & Role Management:
Managers can add, update, or remove user accounts and change user roles directly from the application.
Roles automatically define department-based access permissions.
